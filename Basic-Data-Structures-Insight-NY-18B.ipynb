    "### 1) Is there a native array data structure in python?\n",
    "Yes, in Python 3 there are two:\n",
    " - [Array module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/array.html) for representing an array of basic values: characters, integers, floating point numbers.\n",
    " - Built-in [bytearray](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bytearray) data structure. Limited to holding bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are **not popular** because of the flexibility and features of the [numpy package](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/user/whatisnumpy.html) and [built-in lists](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#lists) which provide much greater functionality for arrays-like objects.  \n",
    "It is good to remember that arrays are designed to hold **homogeneous** data. For arrays to be efficient, you would have to know the array size in advance to reserve a block of memory for the array. \n",
    "Lists in pythons are implemented as arrays for **homogeneous** data and they are also efficient if you know the size of your list in advance (see below). If the number of items in your array keeps growing, using lists is a good approach, since the memory allocation (the process of reserving memory) is automatically done by Python."

    "No, Python lists are not linked lists, they are [equivalent to arrays](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/programming.html#how-do-you-make-an-array-in-python) in their performance. Most of the time they will use contiguous memory blocks for fast indexing. However, they are **dynamically allocated** arrays, which means that you do not have to worry about reserving memory for the elements in this data structure, and also they can be used to store **heterogeneous** data.

    "When we use for loops in our code, we are using the python high level version of a for loop, and this for loop may not be able to access the optimized functions. \n",
